<p>Generations of christian philosophers who argued about how God who is Spirit interacts with the world, have failed to see the only way in which a Consciousness (God) is able to create a physically real world. Here it is:</p><p>Some people believe that miracles require the suspension of inviolable physical laws. Others state that miracles can be explained in a different way, by God adding a trans-natural power to the powers occurring in nature. </p><p>I have heard this view expressed before by a professor of mine. And I really think it hurts the christian cause. Because the kind of world that the christian faith logically requires – as you will realize when I describe it – does not need nor even favor any trans-natural powers.</p><p>The only thinkable way in which a Consciousness (God) can create a physical world is by imagining it. This is analogous to the movie matrix in which people live in a world, where every bit of matter, light, and quantum particles is simulated. Which means, that for the world to continually exist, God must continually think it. And this of course includes all natural laws. </p><p>For anything to happen at all, for you to think a thought, God must think you thinking. Hence miracles are nothing but God thinking that they happen, God willing them. There is no trans-natural powers at work, no physical laws being broken, because the physical laws are realized by the same process that the miracles are realized: God imagining it happening.</p></div></article></body></html>
